Hey there! This is some of the code I wrote during my internship with Razbury Games. 

Most of this code is for the UI of the game and concerns itself with displaying the info about each character in an 
online session to character sheets that the players can pull out using the handle on the side bar. 

I wrote these scripts while considering a large already established coding base and pre existing systems that I had to use and work around.

The main challenges I faced while writing these scripts was using as little of the update function as possible and working around and
with large systems. 

I also tested this code and made adjustments after finding bugs and heavily commented it so it could be understood later by another employee.
